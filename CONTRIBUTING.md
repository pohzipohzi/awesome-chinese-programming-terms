# Contribution Guidelines

Our general philosophy is to keep this list concise and prevent words of similar nature from appearing in different parts of the list:

### Generalise overly specific terms

The terms `Depth-First Search` and `Breadth-First Search` are of similar nature, thus we condense both of them into one term (`Search`) and leave both of them as usage examples.

Other examples may be harder to determine. For example, `Front End` and `Back End` are terms of similar nature, but the term `End` does not make much sense by itself and it's chinese equivalent extends into more distant terms such as `Port`. In this case grouping the terms may offer better readability but the organisation remains debatable.

### Prioritize terms over concepts

The concept `CAP` consists of three terms `Consistency`, `Availability`, and `Partition Tolerance`, each of which are closely related to other important terms such as `Eventual Consistency` or `Disk Partition`. Here we keep the three of them as separate terms and simply leave out `CAP` entirely.

### Avoid duplicate usage examples

Many programming terms are combinations of other terms. For example, the term `Document Object Model` is closely related to three other terms. In this case, we leave it as a usage example in only one of the terms, preferably the one that is closest to it's intended meaning (although that is usually debatable).

### Keep it relevant

Many commonly seen chinese terms in programming communities may be useful in informal settings, but are not actual 'real' programming terms. Examples include `996` (work from 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week) and `牛逼` (some variant of 'awesome' or 'capable'). We try to avoid such terms in the current list.
